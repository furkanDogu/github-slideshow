# Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Introducing GitHub

Welcome to **your** repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through. See a word you don't understand? We've included an emoji ðŸ“– next to some key terms. Click on it to see its definition.

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

I'm the GitHub Learning Lab bot and I'm here to help guide you in your journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact, I already added an issue for you to check out.

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!

This course is using the :sparkles: open source project [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). In some cases weâ€™ve made changes to the history so it would behave during class, so head to the original project repo to learn more about the cool people behind this project.
